# Debugger window

The XR Interaction Toolkit Debugger window displays a top-down view of all the Input Devices, Interactables, and Interactors in a scene. It also displays their relationship to each other and their parent Interaction Managers. To open this window, go to **Window &gt; Analysis &gt; XR Interaction Debugger** from Unity's main menu.

You must be in Play mode to use this window.
